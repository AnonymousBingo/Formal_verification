# Formal Analysis of STRP Protocol using ProVerif

This repository contains the ProVerif scripts for the formal security analysis of the STRP protocol. The analysis covers two main phases of the protocol: Registration and Authentication.

## Overview

The STRP protocol is designed to enable secure communication and mutual authentication between users and multiple services in a multiserver environment. This formal analysis aims to verify key security properties under the Dolev-Yao attacker model, which assumes the attacker has full control over the network.

## Tool Used

- **ProVerif:** An automatic cryptographic protocol verifier. More information can be found on the [ProVerif website](https://proverif.inria.fr/).

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following ProVerif (`.pv`) files:

- `Registration.pv`: Models the registration phase where entities (Users/Servers) establish their identities and credentials with an Admin Server. This phase is assumed to occur over a secure (private) channel.
- `Authentication.pv`: Models the authentication phase where a User authenticates to one or more Servers (Si, Sj) potentially involving interaction with an Admin Server. This phase largely occurs over public channels.
- `Authentication_output.txt`: This file contains the actual output that the Proverif script Authentication.pv generates.
- `Registration_output.txt`: This file contains the actual output that the Proverif script Registration.pv generates. 

## Security Properties Verified

The ProVerif scripts check for the following crucial security properties:

1.  **Secrecy:**
    - Confidentiality of long-term secret keys (e.g., `skE_actual`, `skAS_actual`, `skU_actual`, `skSi_actual`, `skSj_actual`).
    - Confidentiality of session-specific secrets generated during the protocol execution (e.g., `state_u`, `state_si`, `C_challenge`).
2.  **Authentication (Correspondence):**
    - Ensuring that when one party (e.g., a server) believes it has successfully authenticated another party (e.g., a user), the latter party indeed actively participated in the protocol with the intention to authenticate.
    - Verified for:
      - Admin Server completing registration initiated by an Entity.
      - Server Si authenticating User U.
      - Server Sj authenticating User U (in the context of communication involving Si).
3.  **Integrity (Injectivity):**
    - Ensuring a one-to-one mapping between corresponding protocol events (e.g., an authentication completion event at a server uniquely corresponds to an authentication initiation event by a user). This helps protect against certain forms of replay and impersonation attacks.

## Modeling Assumptions

Key assumptions made in the ProVerif models include:

- **Ideal Cryptography:** Cryptographic primitives (hashing, signatures, encryption) are assumed to be perfect (e.g., no algorithmic weaknesses).
- **Dolev-Yao Attacker:** The attacker can intercept, modify, inject, and delete messages on public channels but cannot break ideal cryptographic primitives without the necessary keys.
- **Private Channel for Registration:** The `Registration.pv` model assumes a secure (confidential and authenticated) channel between the Entity and the Admin Server (denoted `E_AS: channel [private]`).
- **Abstracted Operations:** Certain operations, like exponentiation (`pow`), are modeled as uninterpreted functions with their defined properties. Timestamp freshness checks and out-of-band verifications mentioned in protocol descriptions are generally abstracted and not explicitly modeled unless directly influencing message flow or cryptographic operations.
- **Pre-shared Keys/Trust:** The existence and secure pre-distribution of certain public keys or trust relationships are assumed where necessary (e.g., servers knowing public keys of other trusted servers or the Admin Server).

## How to Run the Scripts

To verify the protocols using ProVerif:

1.  Ensure ProVerif is installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the `.pv` files.
3.  Run ProVerif from the command line:

    ```bash
    proverif Registration.pv
    proverif Authentication.pv
    ```

4.  Examine the output. ProVerif will indicate whether the queried properties hold (`RESULT ... is true`) or if it found a potential attack trace.

## Disclaimer

This formal analysis provides a level of assurance regarding the specified security properties within the defined model. It does not cover all possible security aspects, such as side-channel attacks, denial-of-service vulnerabilities not related to logical flaws, or implementation errors.
